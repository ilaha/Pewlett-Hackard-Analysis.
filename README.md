# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.



## Project Overview

- As Pewlett-Hackard has been around for a long time, the initial staff that were hired are about to retire. The company is looking for the analysis for two things:
 *1. Offering retirement package for those that meet certain criterias;
 *2. Which positions would need to be filled in the near future. 

By using SQL I performed the following analysis and I was able to locate who exactly will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions would the company need to fill. 


## Results:

- The company currently has over **300,000** employees (_300,024 to be exact_). 

- In total salary for the current employees is **$15,892,491,033.00**:

- By creating a unique titles table, I was able to avoid the double counting for the employees that has been working for the same company for a long time and had different titles. In total, there are expected **90398** employees are going to retire in the next few year. 

    - While the highest number of retiring employees are Senior Engineers, here's the breakdown of the number of retiring titles from each department:

## Summary:

- If we count the number of employees who were born in 1965 year and have been with Prewlett- Hackard since the first day in 1985, there are 1549 employees that could be considered as mentors today. 

- While the highest number of employees retiring will be from the engineering department, especially senior engineers, the company can use mentor assets and have the current employees trained (_of course who are willing_). By training some of the current employees and helping them to step up on their careers, will also save a lot money and resources for the company, rather than hiring new employees.
